The main project of Tildah was Majenna POS, a cloud-based POS software developed mainly by myself with little teams of internals joining from time to time. It handles many aspects of commercial stores, fast foods, restaurants, and coffee shops, from article management to sales analytics.

Then we started to enhance the project progressively. At the time when I left it, it was a kind of social network that gathers instructors (60), students (5000 subscriptions), parents, and internal company administrators, with multiple features like exams, forums, internal points management, and pricing plans management, analytics, payments...`

  about: `Having a special career path, mixing web development with entrepreneurship, I'm a person who is attracted by the kind of challenges in which a fast delivery is required without losing a strong team building.

I'm a senior web developer and a tech team lead feeling comfortable switching between these two interpolating roles. Interested in working in environments where people are treated and respected as humans and in which our values are not lost during the quest for business success. 
Trying to understand the secrets of building such an environment is a fascinating topic for me.
And any collaboration setting these goals is a challenge I would do all my best to solve.`,
